					<p>Gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have almost only been detected at the very high mass end, likely because lower mass mergers have weaker signals. <b>But what if there is another reason - mergers within a certain mass range are actually less common?</b></p>
					<p>Radial expansion of a star in a binary is thought to be crucial for the creation of a black hole binary that merges in a gravitational wave event. During expansion, the outer layers of a star can be stripped off by a binary companion star, leaving the hot helium core exposed - a stripped star (Figure 1). If the envelope-stripping is unstable, the companion is engulfed in the envelope and the stars spiral so close to each other that a gravitational wave merger can occur.</p>
					<p>However, in low-metallicity environments such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), expansion is predicted to occur very late in a star’s lifetime, which directly impacts the future envelope-stripping and its outcome. Since stripped stars are also a product of the radial expansion of one star in a binary, <b>we predict that late expansion should result in noticeable features in the mass distribution of stripped stars - something that could be testable in the nearby SMC.</b></p>
					<p>Using the stellar evolution code MESA and a binary stellar population synthesis code, we model the mass distribution of stripped stars in the SMC (Figure 2). We expect a drop in the number of stripped stars with masses above 7 M<sub>☉</sub> due to the late expansion of their progenitors.</p>
					<p>If the lack of stripped stars we predict does affect the creation of black holes, this should leave a feature in the low-mass end of the black hole mass distribution as well - a distribution that will be revealed in the coming years.</p>

If, as expected, massive stars expand late at low metallicity (pink distribution), the number of stripped stars we expect to observe between 7-22 M<sub>☉</sub> is nearly half what we would expect otherwise (blue distribution).</figcaption>
